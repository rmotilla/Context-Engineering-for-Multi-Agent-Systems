        "**Goal:** This notebook is the final demonstration for Chapter 7, showcasing our fully upgraded Context Engine as a complete, functional application: the **NASA-Inspired Research Assistant**. Here, we will witness the culmination of our work on verifiability and security. The engine will tackle a complex research query, leveraging its new capabilities to produce a precise, citable, and secure response.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the following key capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **High-Fidelity RAG in Action:** See the upgraded `Researcher` agent retrieve information from our new knowledge base and programmatically generate citations for its claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent Defenses at Work:** Observe how the `helper_sanitize_input` function provides a silent but essential layer of security, protecting the engine from potentially tainted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Complex, Dynamic Planning:** Analyze the technical trace to deconstruct the sophisticated, multi-step plan the `Planner` autonomously creates to answer a multi-faceted research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verifiable, End-to-End Output:** The final result will be a clear, synthesized answer followed by a list of the source documents used, proving the system is not just powerful, but trustworthy."
