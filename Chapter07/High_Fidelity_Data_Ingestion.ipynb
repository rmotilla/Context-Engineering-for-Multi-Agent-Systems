        "**Goal:** This notebook transforms our basic data pipeline into a high-fidelity ingestion system, a crucial prerequisite for the verifiable, citation-capable AI we are building in Chapter 7. We will simulate the work of a secure \"Data Management Department\" by taking raw source documents and processing them into a structured, metadata-rich knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process involves three key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prepare a Curated Dataset:** We will create and load several sample NASA technical documents, simulating a secure, pre-vetted data source ready for our engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Enrich Data with Source Metadata:** This is the core upgrade. We will modify the ingestion process to tag every single data chunk with its original document source, a critical step that enables verifiability and citations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verify the Ingestion:** We will conclude by running a test query to inspect the vector database and confirm that our high-fidelity metadata has been successfully stored.\n",

        "The Perseverance rover's primary mission on Mars is to seek signs of ancient life and collect samples of rock and regolith (broken rock and soil) for possible return to Earth. The rover has a drill to collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils, and sets them aside in a \"cache\" on the surface of Mars. The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars. Perseverance carries the Ingenuity Helicopter, a technology demonstration to test the first powered flight on Mars.\n",
