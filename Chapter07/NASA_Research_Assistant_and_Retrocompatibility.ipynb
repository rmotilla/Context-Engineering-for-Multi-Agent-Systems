        "**Goal:** This notebook serves a dual purpose. Its primary goal is to demonstrate our fully upgraded Chapter 7 Context Engine as a complete, functional application: the **NASA-Inspired Research Assistant**. We will also perform rigorous validation by running **backward compatibility tests** for the key workflows from Chapters 5 and 6. This process showcases not only the engine's new capabilities for verifiability and security but also its stability as an evolving, enterprise-grade system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the following key capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **System Validation & Backward Compatibility:** Before testing the new features, we will run the key workflows from previous chapters to prove that our latest upgrades have not compromised existing functionality, demonstrating the stability of our modular architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **High-Fidelity RAG in Action:** See the upgraded `Researcher` agent retrieve information from our new knowledge base and programmatically generate citations for its claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent Defenses at Work:** Observe how the `helper_sanitize_input` function provides a silent but essential layer of security, protecting the engine from potentially tainted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Complex, Dynamic Planning:** Analyze the technical trace to deconstruct the sophisticated, multi-step plan the `Planner` autonomously creates to answer a multi-faceted research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verifiable, End-to-End Output:** The final result will be a clear, synthesized answer followed by a list of the source documents used, proving the system is not just powerful, but trustworthy.\n",

Establish consistent criteria for evaluating progress and outcomes over time.  \n3. Ensure that all participants share a common understanding of the project’s intended results.  \n4. Provide a structured basis for planning, decision-making, and potential adjustments as the work evolves.  \n5. Facilitate transparent communication about what success looks like and how it will be assessed.\n\nDesign  \nThe design is structured to support these objectives in a clear, systematic way:\n\n1. Framework and Structure  \n- Use a phased approach that moves from initial scoping to implementation and evaluation.  \n- Clearly document roles, responsibilities, and communication channels for all involved parties.  \n- Integrate checkpoints and review cycles to confirm alignment with the defined objectives.\n\n2. Methodology  \n- Apply standardized methods or protocols appropriate to the context (e.g., research methods, development processes, or operational procedures).  \n- Combine quantitative and qualitative measures where relevant to capture both measurable results and contextual insights.  \n- Include risk identification and mitigation steps within the process.\n\n3. Data and Measurement  \n- Define specific indicators or metrics that reflect the stated objectives.  \n- Determine data collection methods, frequency, and tools in advance to ensure consistency.  \n- Establish processes for validating, storing, and analyzing collected data.\n\n4. Implementation Plan  \n- Break the work into clearly defined tasks, milestones, and timelines.  \n- Allocate resources (people, time, budget, tools) in accordance with priorities and constraints.  \n- Incorporate feedback loops so that insights from earlier stages can inform later decisions.\n\n5. Evaluation and Continuous Improvement  \n- Plan periodic assessments comparing actual outcomes to the original objectives.  \n- Document findings and lessons learned for future reference and refinement.  \n- Allow for iterative updates to the design based on evidence, stakeholder input, and changing conditions.\n\nOverall, the content is designed to remain neutral, focusing on clarity, structure, and practical usability, without favoring any particular organization, product, or viewpoint."

        "Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program. Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its primary mission, it received a mission extension. Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It is also searching for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar arrays, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.\n",

Far from the Sun, where light was thin and weak, those wings had to catch every bit of sunlight to make power. Other spacecraft that visited the outer planets had carried their own steady heat-power inside them, but Juno depended only on the Sun, even this far from home.\n\nAs Jupiter grew bigger and bigger in Juno’s view, the planet didn’t look peaceful. Dark belts and bright bands swirled like giant storms, and deep inside, hidden from sight, powerful winds howled faster than a race car. Juno’s job was to dive close and listen: to feel Jupiter’s gravity tug at it, to sense the invisible pull of its strong magnetic field, and to peer—using its scientific instruments—into the planet’s secret heart. Was there a rocky core? How much water hid in the deep, thick clouds? How was all that mass and wind arranged inside?\n\nThe closer Juno flew, the more dangerous it became. Around Jupiter’s poles, the magnetic forces twisted and cracked with energy, making a wild, stormy magnetosphere that could fry delicate electronics in a flash. Invisible particles raced in spirals, like tiny bullets. Juno had to slip through this storm, turning just right, keeping its solar wings steady so it wouldn’t tumble. If it succeeded, it would map Jupiter’s gravity and magnetism, tracing the shape of the unseen world beneath the clouds.\n\nIn the shadow of the giant planet, with only a thin glow of sunlight on its panels, Juno whispered silently through space, trusting its careful path. One mistake would mean being torn away or broken by Jupiter’s forces. But if it stayed on course, it would turn danger into knowledge, carrying home the story of how the biggest planet in our solar system was born."

Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin floated in their seats, strapped in, helmets on, eyes fixed on the strange, rocky world below.\n\nInside their small cabin, the only sounds were the gentle hiss of air, the soft clicking of switches, and the steady, calm voices on the radio.\n\n“Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has begun powered descent,” Neil reported.\n\nThe engine hummed beneath them, a low, steady push. Outside, dust and bright rocks slid past as Eagle dropped lower and lower. The Moon’s surface was no longer a faraway circle in the sky. It was right there—close enough that Neil could see tiny craters and long, dark shadows.\n\nBuzz watched the numbers glowing on his computer. “Altitude… velocity… looking good,” he said. His voice was firm and steady. He had practiced these words many times, but now they were real.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp beeping sound cut through the cabin.\n\n“Program alarm,” Buzz called. Little red lights flashed on the panel: 1202.\n\nNeil’s heart thumped a little harder, but his hands stayed calm on the controls. He could feel a slight tremble in the spacecraft as the engine pushed them down.\n\n“Houston, give us a reading on that program alarm,” Neil said.\n\nFar away on Earth, engineers listened and checked their own screens. A voice came back through the speaker: “Eagle, Houston. We’re go on that alarm. You’re good to continue.”\n\n“Roger. Go,” Neil replied. The flashing lights still blinked, but now they knew: they could keep going.\n\nThe ground rushed closer. Buzz looked out his window and then back to the gauges. “Seven hundred feet… down at three,” he called, giving Neil the numbers he needed. “Rate of descent… looks good.”\n\nAnother alarm chimed. Another code: 1201 this time. Buzz’s gloved hands moved quickly over the computer keys.\n\n“Same type,” Houston said after a breathless pause. “We’re go on that alarm too.”\n\nNeil and Buzz shared a quick look. The Moon’s surface now showed bigger and bigger rocks, like boulders in a dry, gray sea.\n\nAt first, the computer wanted to land them in a spot ahead. But Neil could see that it was filled with rocks and a deep crater—far too rough.\n\nHe wrapped his hand around the control stick. “I’m taking over,” he said quietly.\n\nThe spacecraft responded to his gentle touch, drifting sideways over the rocky field. Neil guided Eagle like a careful pilot landing on a tiny, uneven runway.\n\nBuzz kept his eyes on the gauges. “Fuel is getting low,” he called. His voice stayed calm, but each word felt important. “One hundred feet… down at two… forward, a little.”\n\nThey were close now. Through the window, fine gray dust swirled like smoke as the engine pushed against the ground. It made it harder to see. The landing legs stretched out beneath them, searching for the surface.\n\n“Sixty seconds of fuel remaining,” came the voice from Houston.\n\nOnly one minute of fuel left.\n\nNeil felt a small bead of sweat tickle his forehead inside the helmet, but his hands did not shake. This was what all the training was for—every practice, every test. He adjusted the thrust, slowing their fall.\n\n“Forty feet… down at two,” Buzz said. “Picking up some dust. Thirty feet. Down a half.”\n\nThey were almost there. The Moon looked close enough to touch.\n\n“Contact light!” Buzz suddenly called. A small blue light on the panel glowed—they had touched the surface.\n\nNeil cut the engine. For a heartbeat, everything was perfectly still and silent.\n\nThen Buzz’s voice came, full of quiet pride. “Engine stop.”\n\nThe little lunar module rested gently on the Moon, balanced on its metal legs. No more beeping alarms. No more rushing ground. Only stillness.\n\nOn Earth, millions of children looked up at the night sky, not knowing every code number or fuel count, but feeling the excitement. The Moon, which had always seemed so far away, now had visitors.\n\nInside Eagle, two astronauts took a deep breath. They had faced alarms, low fuel, and tricky ground. They had trusted each other, trusted their training, and stayed calm, step by step.\n\nFar across the empty space, the voice from Houston finally said the words the whole world was waiting for:\n\n“We copy you down, Eagle.”"
