        "**Goal:** This notebook serves a dual purpose. Its primary goal is to demonstrate our fully upgraded Chapter 7 Context Engine as a complete, functional application: the **NASA-Inspired Research Assistant**. We will also perform rigorous validation by running **backward compatibility tests** for the key workflows from Chapters 5 and 6. This process showcases not only the engine's new capabilities for verifiability and security but also its stability as an evolving, enterprise-grade system.\n",

        "This notebook demonstrates the following key capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **System Validation & Backward Compatibility:** Before testing the new features, we will run the key workflows from previous chapters to prove that our latest upgrades have not compromised existing functionality, demonstrating the stability of our modular architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **High-Fidelity RAG in Action:** See the upgraded `Researcher` agent retrieve information from our new knowledge base and programmatically generate citations for its claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent Defenses at Work:** Observe how the `helper_sanitize_input` function provides a silent but essential layer of security, protecting the engine from potentially tainted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Complex, Dynamic Planning:** Analyze the technical trace to deconstruct the sophisticated, multi-step plan the `Planner` autonomously creates to answer a multi-faceted research question.\n",

            "text/markdown": "**Definition**\n\nThe Juno mission is a NASA Jupiter orbiter launched on 5 August 2011 that entered a polar orbit around Jupiter on 5 July 2016. It is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter (after Galileo) and is the most distant solar‑powered mission to date, using large solar arrays instead of radioisotope power systems. Its primary purpose is to measure Jupiter’s composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere to improve understanding of the planet’s formation and evolution.\n\n---\n\n**Function/Operation**\n\nJuno’s design and operations are tightly optimized for science return in Jupiter’s extreme radiation environment:\n\n- **Orbital configuration**  \n  - Juno follows a **polar orbit**, repeatedly passing over Jupiter’s poles to obtain direct measurements of the polar magnetosphere and auroral regions, and to achieve global coverage for gravity and magnetic‑field mapping.  \n  - The orbit is **highly elliptical**, bringing the spacecraft very close to Jupiter for brief science passes, then carrying it far out to minimize time in the intense radiation belts and thereby reduce cumulative radiation dose.\n\n- **Radiation mitigation**  \n  - A dedicated **radiation vault** houses critical electronics, shielding them from high‑energy charged particles.  \n  - The combination of trajectory design (highly elliptical, polar passes) and physical shielding enables long‑duration operation in an otherwise hostile environment.\n\n- **Power and attitude control**  \n  - Juno is **solar‑powered**, using large solar arrays to generate sufficient power at Jupiter’s distance, where solar flux is much weaker than at Earth.  \n  - It is **spin‑stabilized**, maintaining attitude stability through rotation, which reduces reliance on continuous thruster or reaction‑wheel activity and helps conserve propellant.\n\n- **Instrumentation**  \n  - The spacecraft carries an integrated suite of instruments designed to:  \n    - Measure the **gravitational field** with high precision.  \n    - Map the **magnetic field** and probe its generation in the deep interior.  \n    - Determine **atmospheric composition**, including water and other volatiles, as well as temperature and cloud‑level dynamics.  \n    - Characterize the **polar magnetosphere** and **auroral emissions**.\n\nTogether, these operational features allow Juno to collect coordinated measurements of Jupiter’s interior, atmosphere, and magnetosphere.\n\n---\n\n**Key Findings/Impact**\n\nWithin its overarching goal of elucidating Jupiter’s origin and structure, Juno’s investigations focus on several key scientific domains:\n\n- **Gravity science and internal structure**  \n  Precise tracking of Juno’s motion in Jupiter’s gravity field constrains the planet’s internal mass distribution. These data are used to infer whether Jupiter has a distinct core, how that core is structured, and how mass is distributed in the deep interior. This directly informs models of Jupiter’s internal structure and formation history.\n\n- **Magnetic field and dynamo processes**  \n  Global mapping of Jupiter’s magnetic field reveals its strength, geometry, and spatial variability. By linking these measurements to the planet’s deep interior, Juno provides insight into the dynamo processes that generate the field and their relationship with the polar magnetosphere.\n\n- **Atmospheric composition, water abundance, and dynamics**  \n  Measurements of atmospheric composition—especially the abundance of **water** and other volatiles—combined with temperature profiles and cloud‑level dynamics, constrain the total water content of Jupiter and the distribution of key species. These results are critical for testing theories of giant‑planet formation, which make distinct predictions about water and heavy‑element enrichment.\n\n- **Auroras and polar magnetosphere**  \n  Direct sampling of the polar magnetosphere and associated **auroral regions** clarifies how Jupiter’s magnetic field interacts with the solar wind and with material from within the Jovian system. This improves understanding of auroral processes and the coupling between the magnetosphere, atmosphere, and interior.\n\n- **Formation history of Jupiter and the Solar System**  \n  By integrating gravity, magnetic, and atmospheric measurements, Juno provides stringent constraints on Jupiter’s core structure, composition, and water content. These constraints feed directly into models of giant‑planet formation and migration, thereby informing broader theories of the early Solar System’s evolution.\n\nIn sum, Juno’s specialized architecture—polar, highly elliptical orbit; radiation‑mitigation strategies; solar‑power system; and spin‑stabilized design—enables high‑precision measurements that significantly advance knowledge of Jupiter’s interior, atmosphere, magnetosphere, and formation, with broad implications for understanding giant planets in our Solar System and beyond."

        "Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter. It was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5, 2011, as part of the New Frontiers program. Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, to begin a scientific investigation of the planet. After completing its primary mission, it received a mission extension. Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. It is also searching for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 618 kilometers per hour (384 mph). Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar arrays, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. For Juno, however, the three largest solar array wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.\n",

Lightning flashed deep inside the clouds. Great storms spun slowly, like enormous, angry eyes. But Juno did not turn away.\n\nIt flew in a strange path, up over the top of Jupiter, then down under the bottom, looping from pole to pole. With each silent swing, Juno drew closer, as if it were sneaking a peek at a secret.\n\nThree long, shining wings stretched from its sides—solar panels, dark and glittering. They caught the faint sunlight this far from the Sun, feeding Juno with just enough power to keep going. Slowly, steadily, they also kept it balanced, like the wings of a bird gliding through night.\n\nInside, Juno listened.\n\nIt listened for the tug of Jupiter’s gravity, feeling where the planet was heavy and where it was light, as if weighing its hidden heart. It listened for whispers in the planet’s invisible shield, the magnetic field, where invisible lines of force bent and snapped and danced around the poles.\n\nIt sniffed the thin, deep gases, trying to taste how much water hid far below the clouds. It searched for the shape of something hard at the center—a rocky core buried under layers of storms.\n\nDown below, fierce winds roared, racing around and around the planet, faster than the strongest hurricanes on Earth. Juno could not see them, but it could sense them, like distant footsteps in the dark.\n\nNo one had ever come this close to Jupiter’s secrets before.\n\nAlone in the cold, Juno circled again, its three wings gleaming faintly. Each time it passed over the glowing, shimmering poles, past curtains of color that rippled like ghostly green and purple fires, it gathered more clues.\n\nJupiter spun slowly beneath it, huge and mysterious.\n\nJuno watched.\n\nAnd listened.\n\nAnd waited for the planet to tell its story."

Craters. Shadow.\n\nInside, everything hums and clicks.  \nLights glow. Buttons stare back.  \nNeil’s gloved hand hovers over the controls.\n\nThe computer is supposed to land them.  \nIt should guide them down, gentle and sure.  \nBut something is wrong.\n\nThe ground below does not look safe.  \nSharp rocks jut up like teeth.  \nDark holes yawn open, waiting.\n\n“Program alarm,” the computer says with a cold little beep.  \nA harsh sound in the cramped cabin.  \nAnother alarm. Louder this time.  \nRed numbers flash.\n\nFor a moment, the world narrows to sound.  \nBeep.  \nBeep.  \nBeep.\n\nNeil’s heart thuds in his ears.  \nBuzz watches the numbers.  \nMichael circles far above them in the Command Module, alone in the black.\n\nMission Control crackles in their headsets.  \nVoices from a whole other world.  \n“Alarm… stand by…”  \nQuick words, tight voices, no time.\n\nThe computer keeps trying to land them in the wrong place.  \nRight in the middle of the boulder field.\n\nNeil takes a breath.  \nHis hand moves.  \nHe flips the switch.\n\nThe automatic landing is off.  \nNow it’s just him.  \nHis hands.  \nHis eyes.  \nThe Moon.\n\nThe ship tilts, slow but heavy, like a giant metal insect trying to hover.  \nDust blows beneath them in pale gray clouds.  \nThe engines roar, but only through the frame of the ship.  \nOutside, in the vacuum, the sound is swallowed.\n\nFuel ticks away.  \nEvery second, a little less.  \nMission Control watches the numbers fall.\n\n“Sixty seconds,” a voice says from Earth.  \nOne minute of fuel.  \nThat’s all.\n\nNeil guides the lander sideways, away from the boulders.  \nThe ground crawls under them, then drifts.  \nShadows stretch long and thin, hiding holes, hiding danger.\n\nBuzz reads out the data, fast and steady.  \nAltitude. Speed.  \nHis voice is calm, but his breathing is not.\n\n“Thirty seconds.”\n\nThe words hang in the air like ice.  \nIf they don’t land soon, they’ll have to give up, fire the engine, and claw back into space.  \nIf the fuel runs out too low, there’s no second chance.\n\nThe computer alarms again.  \nCold beeps. Angry lights.  \nThe ship’s brain is overloaded, busy with too many things at once.\n\n“Is it safe to continue?” they had asked only moments ago.  \nNow there is no time to ask again.\n\nNeil ignores the noise.  \nHe focuses on the shadows on the ground.  \nOn a patch that looks flatter.  \nSmoother.  \nSafer.\n\nHe eases the controls.  \nThe Moon rises to meet them, dust and rock gliding closer, closer.\n\n“Forward… forward…” Buzz calls.  \n“Down… down…”  \n\n“Fifteen seconds.”\n\nThe fuel warning bites at the edge of his thoughts.  \nAlmost empty.  \nAlmost too late.\n\nThe ship shudders as it slows.  \nDust boils up beneath them, hiding everything.  \nFor a heartbeat, they are blind.\n\nNo boulders. No craters.  \nJust swirling gray.\n\nNeil holds the controls steady.  \nHe can’t see the ground.  \nHe has to trust his training.  \nHis hands.  \nThe feel of the machine.\n\nThen, through the dust, the surface appears.  \nFlat.  \nStill.\n\nThe descent rate falls.  \nThe roar in the structure softens.\n\nA tiny bump.\n\nThe lander’s legs touch the Moon.\n\nFor a second, nobody speaks.  \nThe alarms are silent.  \nThe fuel countdown stops.  \nThe ship rests on the gray, powdery surface, balanced on its thin legs.\n\nThen the voice from Earth comes, shaking with relief.  \n“Tranquility Base here, the Eagle has landed,” Neil says.\n\nOn the other side of space, people cheer.  \nIn homes, in schools, in crowded living rooms, eyes shine at glowing TV screens.  \nBut here, inside the tiny metal spider perched on a silent world, it is suddenly very quiet.\n\nThe danger has not vanished.  \nThe Moon is still cold and empty.  \nThe black sky outside still holds its secrets.  \nOne wrong move, and the silence could swallow them.\n\nYet for now, the lander is still.  \nAlive.  \nSafe.\n\nNeil looks out at the gray plain, at the sharp shadows and the endless night above.  \nSoon he will open the hatch.  \nSoon he will step down the ladder.\n\nBut in this brief, breathless pause, the memory of alarms, boulders, and ticking fuel hangs in the air.\n\nThey have landed on another world—  \nand it very nearly did not let them."
