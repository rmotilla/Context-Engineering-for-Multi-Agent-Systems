        "*From Prototype to pre-production: Hardening the Context Engine*\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook represents a significant architectural evolution from a monolithic prototype to a modular, pre-production system. It no longer contains the core logic itself but instead acts as a high-level \"Control Deck\" for a powerful multi-agent AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "The engine's components—utility functions, helper classes, specialized agents, the agent registry, and the core planner/executor—have been refactored into a reusable commons library. These modules are dynamically downloaded from a central GitHub repository, ensuring that this notebook always runs the latest, most stable version of the engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow is simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Initialize**: Download the library and set up API clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Configure**: Define all parameters (models, namespaces) in a single config dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Execute**: Provide a high-level goal and run the engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "This modular design promotes maintainability, reusability, and scalability, abstracting away the underlying complexity and allowing the user to focus purely on the task at hand. The output provides both the final generated content and a detailed technical trace for developers.\n"
