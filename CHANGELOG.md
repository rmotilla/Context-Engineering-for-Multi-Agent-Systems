# Changelog

This changelog contains notable updates (past, present, and upcoming) to the **Context Engineering for Multi-Agent Systems** repository.   
🐬 Indicates *new bonus notebooks* to explore. 

## [January 25, 2026 release]
### 🐬New **Sovereign Universal Context Engine:**

The repository now includes `Chapter10/Universal_Context_Engine.ipynb`, a demonstration of the "Glass Box" architecture's domain-agnostic capabilities.
* **Universal Architecture:** Runs both Legal and Marketing use cases using the exact same code base, proving that the engine contains zero business rules and relies entirely on retrieved Context and Control Deck instructions.
  
* **Sovereign Solution:** Utilizes High-Fidelity RAG for verifiable accuracy and fully controlled agents, eliminating black-box unpredictability.
  
* **Dual-Domain Support:** Instructions added for appending Marketing data to the Legal index (`clear_index=False`) to create a unified knowledge base.
  
**Token Analytics Upgrade:**
The `engine.py` core and the dashboard rendering logic have been upgraded to provide rigorous transparency into token usage.
* **Token Tracking:** The Render and Trace Dashboard now explicitly displays **Input Tokens**, **Output Tokens**, and the **Difference** for each step.
  
* **Cost-Efficiency Visibility:** Allows users to immediately gauge the verbosity and cost implications of the model's reasoning process during execution.

## [January 17, 2026 note]

Google Colab comes pre-installed with a library called google-adk that is used for Android development integration which requirements may produce a dependency conflict with the libraries installed in this repository. 
You can ignore this error and proceed to the next cell of the installation section of the notebooks. 

​This notebooks in this repository do not use google-adk, so a dependency conflict will not affect the Context Engine.

### Upgrade Status from OpenAI API GPT-5.1 to GPT-5.2 after evaluation  
The repository has already been upgraded to GPT-5.1, which has improved speed and quality (see November 18, 2025, upgrades).
Some notebooks were running well with GPT-5, and GPT-5.1 added no significant value.
After evaluating GPT-5.2 in the context of this repository with some notebooks such as `Chapter01/Use_Case.ipynb.ipynb`, it appeared that GPT-5.2 did not provide sufficient evidence
of significant improvement over the GPT-5.1 upgrade for latency in the complex chapter-code.    
*Final assessment* 
- GPT-5 works fine for straightforward tasks such as embedding.
- GPT-5.1 significantly improves latency for complex notebooks.
- GPT-5.2 was evaluated. It provides some improvements, but it is not significant for this repository.

### Upgrade
**Execution Visualization:** Updated `execute_and_display` in `Marketing_Assistant.ipynb` and `Legal_assistant_Explorer.ipynb` to utilize the new HTML dashboard renderer instead of standard print statements.
- **Interactive Trace Dashboard:** Introduced `render_trace_dashboard` to visually render the Context Engine's execution trace.
    - Replaces raw text logs with a clean, CSS-styled HTML dashboard.
    - Features collapsible steps, syntax-highlighted JSON, and status badges.
    - Implemented in `Chapter08/Legal_assistant_Explorer.ipynb` and `Chapter09/Marketing_Assistant.ipynb`.

### Upgrade
`Data_Ingestion_Marketing.ipynb` has been updated to clear or append data.
In section *2.Initialize Clients*, we can clear the index of its content or append it:
```python
clear_index = True # If True, empties the index namespaces. If False, appends to the existing index.
```

### Upgraded
**OpenAI API GPT-5.1:** 

GPT-5 has been upgraded to GPT-5.1, which improves API response time.
OpenAI API library has been upgraded to 2.8.1 in `commons/utils.py,` which is now the reference installation file for all notebooks in the repository.

OpenAI provided the following release notes that address, among other issues, latency for reasoning, which is important for MAS programs such as MAS Context Engine.

"We’ve released GPT-5.1 in the API, the next model in the GPT-5 series built to balance intelligence and speed across agentic and coding tasks.
Here’s what’s new in GPT 5.1:

Adaptive reasoning that adjusts thinking time by task complexity—spending more time on complex tasks and responding faster on simple tasks.
New reasoning_effort = 'none' mode, offers a fast, accurate non-reasoning path for **latency sensitive use cases**. *Defaults to none when unspecified.*
Extended prompt caching with retention up to 24 hours to reduce latency for long-running conversations.
Upgrades to coding: more communicative, highly steerable, better code quality, improved frontend UI generation.
New tools: apply_patch (structured diffs) and shell (controlled local CLI).
Pricing: Same pricing and rate limits as GPT-5."

### Fixed 1

Resolved an issue in the Context Engine where the Planner failed to parse valid JSON plans. Added support for the steps key in the LLM response schema to prevent execution errors.

### Fixed 2
- **Moderation API Type:** Resolved a critical formatting issue in `Marketing_Assistant.ipynb` (Cell 4) where the OpenAI Moderation API failed with `Error code: 400` when agents returned structured data (dictionaries or lists). Added logic to serialize these outputs into strings before submission.

### Added
- **JSON Support:** Added `import json` to the execution cell to support data serialization.

### Changed
- **Output Rendering:** Updated the `execute_and_display` function to detect JSON outputs and render them as formatted Markdown code blocks for improved readability in the notebook.
