        "Copyright 2025, Denis Rothman\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we build a multi agent system from scratch. We will use an educational version of the Model Context Protocol for our agents to communicate. You will learn how to define a standard message format. You will create specialized AI agents like a researcher and a writer. You will also build an orchestrator to manage their workflow. Following the steps you will see how these parts work together. We will turn a high level goal into a finished product like a blog post. This gives you a direct understanding of the core ideas behind collaborative AI systems."

            "The Mediterranean-style plate celebrates colorful fruits and vegetables, hearty whole grains, silky olive oil, and plenty of fish. Research links this pattern with a lower risk of heart disease, sharper brain health, and a longer life. The secret sauce? Monounsaturated fats—especially from extra-virgin olive oil—help improve cholesterol balance and keep blood vessels supple, while antioxidant-rich plants and seafood fight oxidative stress and inflammation.\n",

            "Bring it to your table: drizzle olive oil over salads and roasted veggies; swap refined carbs for whole grains like farro or oats; choose fish (think salmon, sardines) a couple of times a week; and pile your plate with produce at every meal. Round it out with nuts, beans, and herbs instead of heavy sauces; savor meals slowly and enjoy with friends—another Mediterranean hallmark linked to well-being. Start today with a drizzle and a colorful plate.\n"
