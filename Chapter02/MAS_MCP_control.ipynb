        "**Making the Agent System More Robust**\n",
        "\n",
        "We will now add several important controls to our multi agent system. These additions will change our functional prototype into a more reliable and intelligent system. We will focus on handling real world failures ensuring data is correct and implementing a quality control process.\n",
        "\n",
        "First we will make our communication with the API more resilient. We will replace the original call_llm function with a new one called `call_llm_robust`. This new function adds an automatic retry mechanism. The system will now attempt to call the API multiple times if it fails. This protects our system from temporary network problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next we will validate all messages. A new function called `validate_mcp_message` will check every message passed between agents. It will confirm that the message is formatted correctly and contains all the required information. This prevents corrupted data from breaking our workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will also expand our agent team with a new `validator_agent`. This agent has one job. It acts as a fact checker. It compares the writer's draft against the researcher's summary to make sure the facts are consistent. This adds a layer of quality control to the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally we will create a self correcting workflow. We will upgrade the orchestrator to include a validation and revision loop. If the validator agent finds a problem with the draft the new logic will send the content back to the writer agent with feedback. The writer will then make a revision. The system can now correct its own mistakes to produce a more accurate final output."

        "Here, the original simple orchestrator has been replaced with the far more intelligent final_orchestrator. This new version is no longer just a linear task manager. It now includes a validation and revision loop. After the writer_agent produces a draft, the orchestrator delegates to the validator_agent. If the validation fails, the orchestrator sends the draft back to the writer with the validator's feedback, creating a powerful, self-correcting system that mimics a real-world editorial process."
