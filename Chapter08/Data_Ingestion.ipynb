        "**Goal:** This notebook transforms our basic data pipeline into a high-fidelity ingestion system, a crucial prerequisite for the verifiable, citation-capable AI we are building in Chapter 8. We will simulate the work of a secure \"Data Management Department\" by taking raw source documents and processing them into a structured, metadata-rich knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process involves three key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prepare a Curated Dataset:** We will create and load several sample Legal documents, simulating a secure, pre-vetted data source ready for our engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Enrich Data with Source Metadata:** This is the core upgrade. We will modify the ingestion process to tag every single data chunk with its original document source, a critical step that enables verifiability and citations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verify the Ingestion:** We will conclude by running a test query to inspect the vector database and confirm that our high-fidelity metadata has been successfully stored.\n",
