        "**Goal:** This notebook transforms our basic data pipeline into a high-fidelity ingestion system, a crucial prerequisite for the verifiable, citation-capable AI we are building in Chapter 9. We will simulate the work of a secure \"Data Management Department\" by taking raw source documents and processing them into a structured, metadata-rich knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process involves three key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prepare a Curated Dataset:** We will create and load several sample Marketing documents, simulating a secure, pre-vetted data source ready for our engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Enrich Data with Source Metadata:** This is the core upgrade. We will modify the ingestion process to tag every single data chunk with its original document source, a critical step that enables verifiability and citations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Verify the Ingestion:** We will conclude by running a test query to inspect the vector database and confirm that our high-fidelity metadata has been successfully stored.\n",

        "2. **`chunk`**: A static text string.\n",
        "3. **`total_vectors_uploaded + j`**: A numeric counter that starts at 0 every time you run the cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why it Appends (Safe)\n",
        "\n",
        "If the **\"new data\"** consists of files with **different filenames** than the previous run:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Run 1 (Old Data):** Processed `OldFile.txt`. ID generated: `OldFile.txt_chunk_0`.\n",
        "* **Run 2 (New Data):** You clear the folder and add `NewFile.txt`. The counter resets to 0. ID generated: `NewFile.txt_chunk_0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the filename (`doc_name`) is part of the ID string, `OldFile.txt_chunk_0` is different from `NewFile.txt_chunk_0`. Pinecone sees them as completely different vectors and keeps both.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Caution (Potential Duplicates)\n",
        "\n",
        "If there is a re-upload of the **exact same file** (same filename) but in a different batch or order:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The counter (`total_vectors_uploaded`) might be different than the first time.\n",
        "* This would generate *new* IDs for the *same* content, resulting in duplicate data in your database rather than an overwrite.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary:** As long as your new data has unique filenames compared to the old data, it will cleanly append to the index.\n",
